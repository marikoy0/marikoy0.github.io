    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I have been coding and working with computer since elementary school, and continued it throughout high school. I took multiple programming classes and competed in multiple web design competitions in Coding Club. My interest in cybersecurity stemmed from an internship I had in my senior year working with people who worked in cybersecurity to protect the Hawaii Department of Education.</p>
